## Image & Link Analysis

### Image SEO (Partially Verified)

- The page includes numerous images (logos, case study visuals, awards, icons).
- **Alt Text Findings:**
  - DOM query retrieved `alt` text for many images.
  - **Good:** Header/footer logos ("EvinceDev"), Shopify logos, award icons ("CMMI level 3", "Top 500 Web Developers Awards 2022"), social icons ("linkedin"), DMCA badge appear to have relevant alt text.
  - **Needs Review:** Several images use generic or potentially repetitive/incorrect alt text. Examples:
    - Case study images: `alt="White Label Food Delivery App Dakarfood"`, `alt="Income Analyzer"` (repeated for different case studies).
    - Testimonial client logos: `alt="Donary"` (repeated).
    - Testimonial client headshots: `alt="Yakov Fisch"` (repeated for different people).
- **Recommendation:** Manually review images identified as needing review and provide unique, descriptive alt text (e.g., "BuildDirect Shopify Case Study Screenshot", "Kerry Biggs Headshot", "Groomie Logo").

### Internal & External Linking

- **Internal Linking:**
  - Links to other service pages (Adobe Commerce, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, etc.) are present under "Looking For Other Services?".
  - Case studies ("Know More") likely link to dedicated portfolio pages.
  - Standard navigation links (Services, Work, Technology, etc.) exist.
  - "Contact Us", "Let's Talk", "Request a Free Demo", "Let's Connect", "Get in Touch" links facilitate user action.
- **External Linking:**
  - Social media links (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) are present in the footer.
  - Partner logos (Microsoft, Shopify, Clutch) might link externally.
  - A link to DMCA.com is in the footer.
- **Observations:** Good use of internal links to related services and likely to case studies. Standard footer links are present. Anchor text relevance for internal links should be checked (e.g., ensuring "Know More" links have appropriate context or title attributes if possible).

## Automated Technical Audit Results

Audits performed on: `https://evincedev.com/shopify-development` (Desktop)

### SEO Audit (Score: 83/100)

- **Passed:** 10 checks
- **Failed:** 2 checks
  - **`link-text` (Critical):** Links do not have descriptive text (e.g., using "Know More" instead of descriptive text like "View BuildDirect Case Study"). This impacts SEO and accessibility.
  - **`crawlable-anchors` (Critical):** Some links are not crawlable (likely missing or invalid `href` attribute).
- **Manual:** 1 check (Structured Data - requires manual verification)
- **Recommendations:** Improve link text, ensure all links have valid `href` attributes.

### Performance Audit (Score: 51/100)

- **Core Web Vitals:**
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): 15.3s (Slow - Target: <2.5s). Element: H1 Tag.
  - FCP (First Contentful Paint): 1.7s (Needs Improvement - Target: <1.8s).
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): 0.106 (Needs Improvement - Target: <0.1).
  - TBT (Total Blocking Time): 190ms (Good - Target: <200ms).
- **Key Issues & Opportunities:**
  - **Render-blocking resources:** `jquery.min.js`, `intlTelInput.min.js` delaying rendering (~330ms potential savings).
  - **Properly size images:** Images should be served in appropriate dimensions.
  - **High LCP:** Needs investigation (likely related to slow server response, large resources above the fold, or render-blocking resources).
- **Page Stats:** 3.5MB total size, 136 requests, 1.1MB third-party code, 3.8s main thread blocking time.
- **Recommendations:** Eliminate render-blocking resources (defer JS), optimize images (size, format, lazy loading), improve LCP.

### Accessibility Audit (Score: 90/100)

- **Passed:** 24 checks
- **Failed:** 3 checks
  - **`meta-viewport` (Critical):** `user-scalable="no"` used, preventing zooming on mobile devices.
  - **`link-name` (Critical):** At least one link lacks a discernible name for screen readers (potentially the scroll-down arrow: `<a href="#bottomSection" class="scrollTo">`).
  - **`heading-order` (Critical):** Heading elements skip levels (e.g., H2 -> H5, H3 -> H6), breaking semantic structure. Affects multiple H5 and H6 elements identified.
- **Manual:** 10 checks (require manual inspection).
- **Recommendations:** Remove `user-scalable="no"` and `maximum-scale=1.0` from viewport meta tag, provide accessible names for all links (e.g., using `aria-label` or visually hidden text), ensure heading elements follow a logical, sequential order (H1 -> H2 -> H3 etc.).

### Other Checks (Updated)

- **Structured Data (Verified Content, Issues Found):**
  - Found 3 `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags.
  - **Script 1 (`Organization`):** Defines Evince Development. Seems generally correct, but references `new.evincedev.com` as the URL, which may need checking against the canonical domain.
  - **Script 2 (`BreadcrumbList`):** Incorrectly references "Product Development Services" instead of Shopify Development. Path: Home > Product Development Services.
  - **Script 3 (`ProfessionalService`):** Incorrectly describes "Product Development Services" and its offerings, not Shopify Development.
  - **Recommendation:** Correct the `BreadcrumbList` and `ProfessionalService` JSON-LD scripts to accurately reflect the Shopify Development page content and hierarchy. Confirm the correct canonical domain for the `Organization` schema URL.
- **Image Alt Text:** Partially verified via DOM query. See "Image SEO" section above for details and recommendations for manual review of specific images.

## Summary & Recommendations (Updated)

Based on the automated audits, DOM queries, and content analysis:

- **Performance is a major concern (51/100):** Focus on improving LCP (15.3s) by addressing render-blocking JS, optimizing images, and potentially server response time. High request count (136) and page size (3.5MB) should also be reduced.
- **Address Critical SEO & Accessibility Issues:**
  - Fix non-descriptive link text (`link-text` audit failure) and ensure all links are crawlable (`crawlable-anchors` audit failure).
  - Correct the heading order (H5/H6 usage violates `heading-order` audit).
  - Remove viewport restrictions (`user-scalable="no"` violates `meta-viewport` audit).
  - Provide accessible names for all interactive elements (violates `link-name` audit).
- **Content Verification & Refinement:**
  - **Title & Meta Description:** Verified. Title is brand-focused; Meta Description is good but could potentially be more specific to the unique value props mentioned in the H1 (AI, custom dev).
  - **Image Alt Text:** Review and update generic/repetitive alt text identified in the DOM query (case studies, testimonials).
  - **Structured Data:** **Verified content reveals inaccuracies.** Correct the `BreadcrumbList` and `ProfessionalService` JSON-LD to match the Shopify Development page. Verify the `Organization` URL.

The page has good keyword integration and relevant basic metadata, but requires significant technical optimization and refinement of specific on-page elements (links, alt text, headings, **structured data**) to improve performance, accessibility, and SEO effectiveness.
