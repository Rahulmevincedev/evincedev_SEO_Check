# AI-Powered SEO Automation with MCP

## Overview

This project uses advanced AI and MCP (Model Context Protocol) automation to perform complete SEO audits and optimizations, dramatically reducing manual effort and saving significant time. The system leverages browser automation, AI-driven analysis, and MCP thinking to deliver actionable SEO, accessibility, and performance insights.

## What Does It Do?

- **Automated SEO Audit** (AI + MCP)
- **Accessibility Audit**
- **Performance Audit**
- **Next.js Audit**
- **Best Practices Audit**
- **Automated Evidence Collection** (screenshots, logs, DOM data)
- **AI-Driven Recommendations & Fixes**

---

## How It Works (MCP + AI Workflow)

1. **Tab Management:**  
   Uses MCP `list_tabs` to focus or open the correct browser tab for the target URL.
2. **Automated Audits:**  
   Runs MCP-powered audits: Accessibility, Performance, SEO, Next.js, Best Practices.
3. **Data Collection:**  
   Collects console logs, network logs, screenshots, and DOM elements automatically.
4. **AI Analysis:**  
   AI reviews audit results, identifies issues (e.g., crawlability, metadata, headings, alt text), and suggests or applies fixes.
5. **Verification Loop:**  
   Re-runs audits after fixes to ensure issues are resolved.
6. **Reporting:**  
   Documents findings, solutions, and attaches evidence (screenshots, logs) for transparency and tracking.

## Why AI + MCP Automation?

- **Saves Time:**  
  Automates repetitive, error-prone manual checks.
- **Consistent & Repeatable:**  
  Ensures every audit follows the same rigorous process.
- **Comprehensive:**  
  Catches issues across SEO, accessibility, and performance.
- **Evidence-Driven:**  
  Automatically collects and attaches proof for every finding and fix.
- **Smart Fixes:**  
  AI suggests or applies best-practice solutions (e.g., fixing non-crawlable anchors, optimizing meta tags, improving alt text).

## Typical Challenges Solved

- Non-crawlable anchors and blocked indexing
- Missing or poor alt text on images
- Incorrect heading structure and meta descriptions
- Performance bottlenecks and accessibility gaps

**How AI/MCP Solves Them:**

- Detects and highlights issues instantly
- Suggests or applies code/content fixes
- Verifies fixes with re-audits
- Documents every step for accountability

## Implementation Steps

1. **Start the MCP Browser Tools Server:**
   ```
   npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@1.2.0
   ```
2. **Launch Chrome with Remote Debugging:**
   ```
   --profile-directory="Default" --remote-debugging-port=9222 -- "%1"
   ```
3. **Run the AI/MCP Audit Workflow:**
   - Focus/open the target tab
   - Run all audits
   - Collect and review results
   - Apply AI-recommended fixes
   - Re-audit and document

---

## Best Practices

- Always use MCP thinking for automation and reporting.
- Document every step, challenge, and solution.
- Attach screenshots and logs as evidence.
- Use the AI/MCP loop: Audit → Fix → Verify → Report.
